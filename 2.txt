2.Write a program which can compute the factorial of a given numbers.The 
results should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single 
line.Suppose the following input is supplied to the program: 8 Then, the 
output should be:40320


def factorial(n):
    value = 1
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        value = value * i
    return value

number = int(input("Type a number: "))
print(factorial(number))
