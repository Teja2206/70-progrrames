6. Write a program that calculates and prints the value according to the given 
formula:
Q = Square root of [(2 * C * D)/H]
Following are the fixed values of C and H:
C is 50. H is 30.
D is the variable whose values should be input to your program in a commaseparated sequence.For example Let us assume the following comma 
separated input sequence is given to the program:
100,150,180
The output of the program should be:
18,22,24


from math import sqrt
C, H = 50, 30
mylist = input().split(',')
print(*(round(sqrt(2*C*int(D)/H)) for D in mylist), sep=",")
